# Tic Tac Toe
###### A tic tac toe game in Ruby with AI and game modes

This project was (and is) my most educating project from learning perspective. Thanks to resources like Stackexchange I practiced to high degree OOP principals such as:
* single responsibility
* polymorphism
* class separation and modularity

in addition to attention for:
* readability
* performance
* functional AI
* ruby style guidelines
